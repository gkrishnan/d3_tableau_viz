# Visualization using D3.js and Tableau

This project aimed at building interesting visualizations for datasets using D3.js and Tableau. 

The dataset used for the D3 portions were characters from Victor Hugo's Les Miserables and for the Tableau part was car and truck data (2004) from http://www.idvbook.com/
